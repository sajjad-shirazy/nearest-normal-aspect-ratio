# Nearest Normal Aspect Ratio

This function returns the nearest aspect ratio of a width and height within a limited range of possible aspect ratios.

In other words, while 649x360 technically has an aspect ratio of 649:360, itâ€™s often useful to know that the nearest normal aspect ratio is actually 9:5 (648x360).

```
nearestNormalAspectRatio(width, height, [side], [maxWidth], [maxHeight])
```

- **width**: The width of the space.
- **height**: The height of the space.
- **side**: The nearest ratio to side with. A number higher than zero tells the function to always return the nearest ratio that is equal or higher than the actual ratio, whereas a smaller number returns the nearest ratio higher that is equal or smaller than the actual ratio. *Defaults to 0.*
- **maxWidth**: The maximum width in the nearest normal aspect ratio. *Defaults to 16.*
- **maxWidth**: The maximum height in the nearest normal aspect ratio. *Defaults to 16.*
